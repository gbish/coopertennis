				<h2>What is Cardio Tennis?</h2>

				<p>Cardio Tennis is a series of tennis-based drills and activities played to up-tempo music on a tennis court. It does not require tennis skills, but is all about keeping your heart rate up, burning calories and having fun. Whether the ball goes in or out is irrelevant as the main purpose is to get fit.  Cardio Tennis is more fun than working out in a gym or other forms of exercise.</p>

				<p>The main purpose of the session is to provide you with an enjoyable work out. It’s not about forehands and backhands, it’s about getting in to your appropriate cardio zone and getting a great workout.</p>

				<p>Why not give it a go?  See attached link for list of sessions.</p>
